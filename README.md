# Project Euler 1 to 100

> *"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."*

Project Euler is a series of mathematical problems which can *usually* only be reasonably solved by using programming. In this repository I will post my solutions of problems 1 to 100, specifically using the language Rust.

## Why are you even doing this?

Welp, I want to learn the syntax of Rust and I want to play a little bit with math, so I dont get *rusty* at it. Yeah I am extremely funny I know thank you a lot.

## Do you post answers?

Nop, but you can just run the code and get the answer, the Project Euler website says:

> *"the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems."*

so I will try to follow this rule, giving answers is no fun, but I think its fine to show some code and my thought process.

In addition to this every solution will have my first try at solving the problem, my last (and hopefully) best method and a little text explaining my ideas and proofs to the specific problem.

## List of solutions:

- 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5

    The intuitive method to solving this exercise is a brute force for loop:
